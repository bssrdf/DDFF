Duplicate Directories and Files Finder
<dennis@yurichev.com>

* How to run it:

Usage: ddff.exe <directory1> <directory2> ...
For example: ddff.exe C:\ D:\ E:\

Results saved into ddff_results.txt file (UTF-8 encoded, can be opened at least in notepad).

Some information (partial and full filehashes) are stored into NTFS streams, so the next
scanning will be much faster.

* Comparison to other duplicate finding utilities:

+ Very fast
+ Comparing only file contents, ignoring file name/attributes. 
+ Comparing directories too.
+ Often, two directories contain, let's say, 4 equal files and 5th file is different.
  We handle it too and output these as "common files in directories"
+ Absence of unnecessary switches.

- Win32 only
- Command-line only

* How it works (tech info):

** Stage 1

Filetree scanned and all information about all files are added.
We cut here all files having unique filesizes, because, they cannot be equal to any other file.

** Stage 2

Partial hashes (SHA512 of first and last 512 bytes) are computed for each file and directory.
Partial hash of directory of files is just SHA512 of all filehashes.
We cut here all files having unique partial hashes.

** Stage 3

Full hashes (SHA512 of the whole file) are computer for each file and directory.
Full hash of directory of files is just SHA512 of all filehashes.
We cut here all files having unique full hashes.

** Preparation to dumping

*** Cut children of all directories

This mean, if directories A and B equal, but their subdirectories are equal to their counterparts
too, we should supress this information and dump information only about A and B directories 
equivalence.

*** Work on fuzzy equal directories
